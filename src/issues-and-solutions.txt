1. To export the snyk results to html you need to install snyk-html, https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-to-html

2. try-catch blocks are not valid directly inside the stages section in a declarative pipeline. Instead, 
you should use the catchError block or wrap the sh steps in a script block for exception handling. 

3. Additional Improvements:
Archive Artifacts:

If you want to archive the generated HTML reports, add the following step after each scan:

archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'ScanResults-opensource-SCA.html', allowEmptyArchive: true
archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'SNYK-SAST-ScanResults.html', allowEmptyArchive: true

Notifications:
You can add a post-build action to send notifications (e.g., email or Slack) if the Snyk scans fail.

-v $(pwd):/app: Mounts the current Jenkins workspace directory ($(pwd)) to the /app directory inside the container.

-e SNYK_TOKEN=$SNYK_TOKEN: Passes the SNYK_TOKEN environment variable to the container.

snyk/snyk:cli: Uses the official Snyk CLI Docker image.

--json-file-output=/app/ScanResults-opensource-SCA.json: Saves the scan results in JSON format to /app/ScanResults-opensource-SCA.json (which maps to the Jenkins workspace).
